A slide/playlist can be restricted in publishing period.
If no publishing is set the default is that the slide/playlist is published.
If you wish to limit the period the slide/playlist is published you can set publishing from,to dates.

A playlist can also use planning rules.

    list "Afspilningsrækkefølge".

    * For each scenario:
      * Choose "Start" and "Slut" so the occurrence will have a duration of 1 hour.
      * Click "Gentag planlægning" to set up repetition rules.
      * Test that the rule applies to the playlist by creating a scenario where the playlist should be shown.
      * Save the playlist.
      * Open the client at `/client` and see that playlist is shown.
      * Change the planning to a scenario where it should not be shown.

### Description

This guide tests setting up a theme and applying it to a slide.

A theme modifies that look of slides. A theme can also supply a logo to slides.

## T5 Screen layouts

### Description

This guide tests setting up screens with different layouts.

A screen can have different layouts. It can be split into different regions.

A special case of screen layouts is "touch-buttons" type for a region. See
https://github.com/os2display/display-templates/blob/develop/src/screen-layouts/touch-template.json#L32. This
converts slides shown in the screen region to buttons that display the slide when pressed. The button text is set
in the slide in the section "Touch region". This requires that touch button is enabled in the installation.

### Steps

* NB! This guide assumes that the layouts in
  https://github.com/os2display/display-templates/tree/develop/src/screen-layouts are installed in the test installation.
* Create a screen.
* Fill "Skærmens navn".
* Select "2-delt" in "Skærmens layout".
* In "Spillelister tilknyttet regionen" two regions should appear.
* Select different playlists for the two regions.
* Save the screen.
* Open the screen in `/client` as described in T1.
* See that the screen is split in the middle and displays the playlists selected.

## T6 External users

### Description

This guide tests inviting external users to the system using the OIDC external setup.

This guide assumes that the test installation has been configured to allow external users through OIDC login.

An external user can be allowed to create content in a tenant by using an activation code, created by an admin user
in the given tenant.

In the following two different users will take part:

* The admin user that has access to create activation code for a given tenant (USER_ADMIN).
* The external user that should be allowed to work in the tenant (USER_EXTERNAL).

### Steps

* Log in as USER_ADMIN in a tenant using "Medarbejder" login.
* Navigate to "Aktiveringskoder" (`/admin/activation/list`).
* Click "Opret ny".
* Choose a name for the external user when they log in.
* Choose the role for the user: "Ekstern bruger"
* Save the activation code.
* You should see a list of created activation code.
* Copy the activation code.
* Log out of the system
* Login as external using MitID.
* Use the activation code.
* You should be logged into the tenant with `ROLE_EXTERNAL_USER` permissions.

NB! If you are already registered as an external user in the system,
you will retain the name you were given with the first activation code.
If you are already added to a tenant, you can be use an activation code to be added to
another tenant in the top menu: "Tilføj" -> "Område".

---

## T7 Campaigns

### Description

This guide tests applying campaigns to screens and screen groups. Screens can be added to a screen group.

Consider the following scenario: A group of screens normally contains some standard content. For one week they should
show some different content (e.g. a festival for one week). Instead of manually removing the normal content and adding
different content when the week starts and manually change back when the week is done, a campaign can be set up.
The campaign will take over the screen for the selected period, and yield control when the period does not apply.

The campaign is a list a slides to show, start and end dates, and a list of screens or screen groups it should
apply to.

Please note that a campaign applies the full area of a screen. It ignores the layout of the screen and applies as if
the screen is running the full screen layout.

### Steps

* Create a slide (SLIDE_1), playlist and screen (SCREEN_1). This should contain default content. See T1. 
* Create another slide (SLIDE_2) that is different from the first.
* Campaign
  * Navigate to "Kampagner" (`/admin/campaign/list`).
  * Click "Opret ny kampagne" (`/admin/campaign/create`).
  * Choose a name and description.
  * Add SLIDE_2 in "Tilknyttede slides".
  * Add SCREEN_1 in "Skærme".
  * Select the campaign period in "Udgivelse".
  * Save the campaign.
  * Test that the campaign applies/does not apply to SCREEN_1 according to the campaign period select.
    * See T1 for setting up the screen SCREEN_1.
* Screen group
  * Create a screen group (GROUP_1) under "Grupper" (`/admin/group/list`).
  * Create a new screen (SCREEN_2)
  * Select GROUP_1 under "Grupper".
  * Save the screen.
  * Edit the campaign created below
  * Set GROUP_1 in "Skærmgrupper".
  * Save the campaign
  * Test that SCREEN_2 displays the campaign.
    * See T1 for setting up the screen.

## T8 Shared playlists

### Description

This guide tests sharing playlists across tenants.

The system consists of different tenants and content is not shared between the different tenants.

The exception to the rule is shared playlists.
A playlist can be configured to be shared between tenants.
When it is shared it can be displayed in another tenant, but not edited.

### Steps

* NB! This guide assumes that more than one tenant is created the tenant and that the tester has access to both tenants.
* Create slide, playlist in one tenant (TENANT_1).
* Edit the playlist and select the other tenant (TENANT_2) in "Del denne spilleliste".
* Save the playlist.
* Change tenant in the top left corner to TENANT_2.
* Navigate to "Delte spillelister" (`/admin/shared/list`).
* See that the playlist is in the list.
* Create a screen in TENANT_2.
* Select "fuld skærm" in "Layout".
* In "Spillelister tilknyttet regionen" tick the box "Vis delte spillelister".
* Attach the shared playlist.
* Save the screen.
* Test that the playlist is displayed on the screen. See T1 for how to activate the screen.

## T9 Feed sources

### Description

Feed sources are the link between external data source and slides. An example is the RSS feed.
When creating a slide with the RSS template a feed source ("datakilde") needs to be selected.
After the feed source has been selected it is possible to input the url to the RSS feed to show data from.
The feed source contains the code that calls the external source and converts data to a format the RSS template
understands.

Feed sources are connected to a tenant. New feed sources can be connected to a tenant in through the
"Datakilde" link in the navigation.

The following guide describes how to add a "calendar api" feed source to a tenant.

NB! The calendar api feed source has some installation requirements that are assumed to have been set up.
See the [documentation](https://github.com/os2display/display-api-service/blob/develop/docs/feed/calender-api-feed.md)
for further information.

With the calendar api feed source the administrator should select which locations are connected with the given tenant.
When creating a slide with the given feed source, the resources that belong to the given locations are available
to deliver data to the slide.

### Steps

* Go to `/admin/feed-sources/list`.
* Click "Opret ny datakilde" (`/admin/feed-sources/create`).
* Select a name (e.g. "My calendar feed") and add a description of the feed source.
* Select "Kalender feed" for "Type".
* It will display "Bemærk! Datakilden skal gemmes før der kan tilkobles lokationer. Gem og åbn datakilden igen.".
* Save with "Gem datakilde".
* Reopen the feed source from the list.
* Select locations that should be connected with the given tenant.
* Save with "Gem datakilde".
* Now the feed source should be available in the feed selector, when setting up a "calendar" slide.
